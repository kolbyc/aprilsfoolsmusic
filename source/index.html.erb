      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p class="blurb">Cousins Kolby Chapman (drums) and Hayden Althuizen (guitar/vocals) have been making music together since before knowing how to really play their instruments. Jams were the highlight of weekend stays at Chapman's parents' house in Abbotsford, BC, where both Althuizen and Chapman were discovering their love for rock and blues.</p>

      <p class="blurb">In December of 2020, the pair officially began their long-distance band amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, with recording for their debut album beginning immediately. With their bombastic-yet-groovin' indie rock sound, April's Fools is set to release their first LP, June 2021. </p>
